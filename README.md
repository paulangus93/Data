# Data

Small-scale projects to generate and analyse datasets, producing meaningful solutions for scientific applications.

# Projects

1. Chaos Theory (coded, to revise)
2. N-body (coded, to revise)

# Chaos Theory

Using the equation x<sub>n + 1</sub> = rx<sub>n</sub>(1 - x<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>), plot x as a function of n for many different r values to demonstrate chaos. From this, we can plot a range of n values as a function of r to create a bifurcation map. Inaccuracy can be visualised by plotting the bifurcation at r=2 at small and large n values.



# N-body
