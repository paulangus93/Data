# Data

Small-scale projects to generate and analyse datasets, producing meaningful solutions for scientific applications.

# Projects

1. Chaos Theory (coded, to revise)
2. N-body (coded, to revise)

# Chaos Theory

Using an iterative equation x<sub>n+1</sub> = rx<sub>n</sub>(1-(x<sub>n</sub>)<super>2</super>), 


# N-body
