# Data

Small-scale projects to generate and analyse datasets, producing meaningful solutions for scientific applications.

# Projects

1. Chaos Theory (coded, to revise)
2. N-body (coded, to revise)

# Chaos Theory

Using the equation x<sub>n + 1</sub> = rx<sub>n</sub>(1 - x<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>) iterated for 0 < n <\le> 3


# N-body
